Stempy H5 Format
================

This file is present to keep a record of the current layout of
the stempy H5 format.

Currently, the structure of the format is as follows:

.. code-block::

   electron_events
   ├── frames
   └── scan_positions
   stem
   └── images
   frames


* 
  ``electron_events/frames`` - Array of arrays, the first index is the scan position
  ( corresponding to ``scan_positions`` ) and the second array holds an array of
  of indices into the diffractogram where an electron strike was detected.


  * Attributes:

    * ``Nx``\ : the width of the frame
    * ``Ny``\ : the height of the frame

* 
  ``electron_events/scan_positions`` - Array of shorts holding the scan positions.


  * Attributes:

    * ``Nx``\ : the width of the scan
    * ``Ny``\ : the height of the scan

* 
  ``stem/images`` - A list of 2D arrays of unsigned integers containing stem images
  (possibly bright and dark fields).


  * Attributes:

    * ``names``\ : a list of names assigned to the images

* 
  ``frames`` - If present, the raw diffractogram data, where the first index is the scan
  position index for the 2D diffractogram.

This file can be produced with the script at ``examples/create_hdf5.py``
by using a command similar to the following:

.. code-block::

   python create_hdf5.py -h 40 -w 40 -v 2 -x 2 -d /data/4dstem/electronCounting/stem4d_0000000235_0000000001.dat /data/4dstem/electronCounting/stem4d_0000000236_0000000009.dat --save-raw

Use ``python create_hdf5.py --help`` for more information about the
options.
