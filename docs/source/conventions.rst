Coordinate Conventions
----------------------

In stempy conventions, the origin is located at the top left corner of
the image. Moving right and down increases x and y, respectively.

For points, such as a `center`, the stempy convention is for it to be a
tuple of `(x, y)` coordinates.

For dimensions, such as `scan_dimensions` or `frame_dimensions`, the
stempy convention is for it to be a tuple of `(width, height)`.
